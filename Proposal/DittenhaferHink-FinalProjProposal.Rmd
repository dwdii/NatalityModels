# Data Set

The data sets we plan to use originate from United States federal government agencies. The core data comes from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  `r citep(bibBirthData)`. Related population and economic data sets will come from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.


## Natality Data

Separate data sets the years 2003-2006, and 2007-2014 were downloaded from the CDC website `r citep(bibBirthData06)`, `r citep(bibBirthData)`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dfNatality <- c("Year", "Month",	"Age of Mother",	"Marital Status",	"Education",	"Births")
kable(dfNatality)
```
